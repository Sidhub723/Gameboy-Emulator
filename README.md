# GAMEBOY EMULATOR
The GameBoy, which is a legendary console from Nintendo, revolutionized portable gaming with its 8-bit graphics and a vast library of classic titles. The primary objective of this project is to recreate the Gameboy's central processing unit (CPU), memory, graphics processing unit (GPU), sound chip, and other essential components. By achieving this objective, the project aims to provide an accurate emulation of the GameBoy hardware, allowing users to play their favorite games while preserving the nostalgic charm of the original console. 

## Implementation Checkpoints
- [x] Basic emulator structure along with the main GB file mimicing the bus, and the CPU and Boot components.
- [x] Implementing addressing modes.
- [ ] Implementing different instruction families.
